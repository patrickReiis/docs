The following features require an [Enterprise license](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/enterprise-licensing):

- [Column-level encryption](https://deploy-preview-17984--cockroachdb-docs.netlify.app/docs/v23.2/column-level-encryption.html) allows you to encrypt one or more of the columns in each row of a database table, and can be useful for compliance scenarios such as adhering to PCI or GDPR. {% comment %}TODO: Update link when #17984 is merged{% endcomment %}
- [Physical cluster replication (Preview)](https://deploy-preview-17989--cockroachdb-docs.netlify.app/docs/v23.2/physical-cluster-replication-overview.html) continuously sends all data at the byte level from a _primary cluster_ to an independent _standby cluster_. Existing data and ongoing changes on the active primary cluster, which is serving application data, replicate asynchronously to the passive standby cluster. In a disaster recovery scenario, you can cut over from the unavailable primary cluster to the standby cluster. This will stop the replication stream, reset the standby cluster to a point in time where all ingested data is consistent, and mark the standby as ready to accept application traffic. {% comment %}TODO: Update link when #17989 is merged{% endcomment %}

Before [upgrading to CockroachDB v23.2](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/upgrade-cockroach-version), be sure to review the following backward-incompatible changes, as well as key cluster setting changes, and adjust your deployment as necessary.

TODO

<h4 id="v23-2-0-cluster-settings">Key Cluster Setting Changes</h4>

The following changes should be reviewed prior to upgrading. Default cluster settings will be used unless you have manually set a value for a setting. This can be confirmed by checking the `system.settings` table (`select * from system.settings`) to view the non-default settings.

Resource             | Topic                                      | Description
---------------------+--------------------------------------------+-------------
Cockroach University | [Introduction to Distributed SQL and CockroachDB](https://university.cockroachlabs.com/courses/course-v1:crl+intro-to-distributed-sql-and-cockroachdb+self-paced/about) | This course introduces the core concepts behind distributed SQL databases and describes how CockroachDB fits into this landscape. You will learn what differentiates CockroachDB from both legacy SQL and NoSQL databases and how CockroachDB ensures consistent transactions without sacrificing scale and resiliency. You'll learn about CockroachDB's seamless horizontal scalability, distributed transactions with strict ACID guarantees, and high availability and resilience.
Cockroach University | [Practical First Steps with CockroachDB](https://university.cockroachlabs.com/courses/course-v1:crl+practical-first-steps-with-crdb+self-paced/about) | This course will give you the tools you need to get started with CockroachDB. During the course, you will learn how to spin up a cluster, use the Admin UI to monitor cluster activity, and use SQL shell to solve a set of hands-on exercises.
Cockroach University | [Building a Highly Resilient Multi-region Database using CockroachDB](https://university.cockroachlabs.com/courses/course-v1:crl+intro-to-resilience-in-multi-region+self-paced/about) | This course is part of a series introducing solutions to running low-latency, highly resilient applications for data-intensive workloads on CockroachDB. In this course we focus on surviving large-scale infrastructure failures like losing an entire cloud region without losing data during recovery. Weâ€™ll show you how to use CockroachDB survival goals in a multi-region cluster to implement a highly resilient database that survives node or network failures across multiple regions with zero data loss.
Cockroach University | [Introduction to Serverless Databases and CockroachDB Serverless](https://university.cockroachlabs.com/courses/course-v1:crl+intro-to-serverless+self-paced/about) | This course introduces the core concepts behind serverless databases and gives you the tools you need to get started with CockroachDB Serverless. You will learn how serverless databases remove the burden of configuring, sizing, provisioning, securing, maintaining and dynamically scaling your database based on load. This means you simply pay for the serverless database resources you use.
