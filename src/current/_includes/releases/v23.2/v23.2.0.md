The following features require an [Enterprise license](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/enterprise-licensing):

- [Column-level encryption](https://deploy-preview-17984--cockroachdb-docs.netlify.app/docs/v23.2/column-level-encryption.html) allows you to encrypt one or more of the columns in each row of a database table, and can be useful for compliance scenarios such as adhering to PCI or GDPR. {% comment %}TODO: Update link when #17984 is merged{% endcomment %}
- [Physical cluster replication (Preview)](https://deploy-preview-17989--cockroachdb-docs.netlify.app/docs/v23.2/physical-cluster-replication-overview.html) continuously sends all data at the byte level from a _primary cluster_ to an independent _standby cluster_. Existing data and ongoing changes on the active primary cluster, which is serving application data, replicate asynchronously to the passive standby cluster. In a disaster recovery scenario, you can cut over from the unavailable primary cluster to the standby cluster. This will stop the replication stream, reset the standby cluster to a point in time where all ingested data is consistent, and mark the standby as ready to accept application traffic. {% comment %}TODO: Update link when #17989 is merged{% endcomment %}

Before [upgrading to CockroachDB v23.2](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v23.2/upgrade-cockroach-version), be sure to review the following backward-incompatible changes, as well as key cluster setting changes, and adjust your deployment as necessary.

<!-- alpha.1 TODO: Remove this comment -->
- The pre-v23.1 output produced by `SHOW RANGES`, `crdb_internal.ranges`, and `crdb_internal.ranges_no_leases` was deprecated in v23.1 and is now replaced by default with output that's compatible with coalesced ranges (anges that pack multiple tables/indexes/partitions into individual ranges). See the [v23.1 release notes]({% link releases/v23.1.md %}) for `SHOW RANGES` for more details. [#102961][#102961]
- When a deployment is configured to use a time zone (new feature) for log file output using formats `crdb-v1` or `crdb-v2`, it becomes impossible to process the new output log files using the [`cockroach debug merge-logs` command]({% link v23.2/cockroach-debug-merge-logs.md %}) from a previous version. The newest `cockroach debug merge-logs` code must be used instead. [#104265][#104265]
- When customizing the [SQL shell's interactive prompt]({% link v23.2/cockroach-sql.md %}), the special sequence `%M` now expands to the full host name instead of the combination of host name and port number. To include the port number explicitly, use `%>`. The special sequence `%m` now expands to the host name up to the first period. [#105137][#105137]
- The [`cockroach debug zip`]({% link v23.2/cockroach-debug-zip.md %}) command stores data retrieved from SQL tables in the remote cluster using the TSV format by default. [#107474][#107474]
<!-- alpha.3 TODO: Remove this comment -->
- The direct export of traces to Jaeger and the [cluster setting](../v23.2/cluster-settings.html) `trace.jaeger.agent` have been removed. The direct export functionality had been obsoleted since 2022; it stopped working altogether sometime in 2023 with the following error: `data does not fit within one UDP packet; size 65006, max 65000, spans NN`. Since 2022, Jaeger supports ingestion of traces using OTLP; and CockroachDB has supported emitting traces using OTLP since v22.1. Operators and developers who want to inspect traces are thus invited to use the OTLP protocol instead. The corresponding cluster setting is `trace.opentelemetry.collector`. For a successful deployment, an intermediate OTLP collector/forwarder should be configured.

  You can orchestrate the OpenTeletry collector and Jaeger together using Docker Compose by adapting the following example:

    ~~~ yaml
    otel-collector:
      image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib
      container_name: otel-collector
      volumes:
        - ./otel-collector-config.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
      ports:
        - 1888:1888 # pprof extension
        - 8888:8888 # Prometheus metrics exposed by the collector
        - 8889:8889 # Prometheus exporter metrics
        - 13133:13133 # health_check extension
        - 4317:4317 # OTLP gRPC receiver
        - 4318:4318 # OTLP http receiver
        - 55679:55679 # zpages extension

    jaeger:
      image: jaegertracing/all-in-one
      container_name: jaeger
      ports:
        - "16685:16685"
        - "16686:16686"
        - "14250:14250"
        - "14268:14268"
        - "14269:14269"
        - "6831:6831/udp"
      environment:
        - COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT=9411
        - COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true
    ~~~

  To configure the `otel-collector`, you can adapt this example:

    ~~~ yaml
    receivers:
      otlp: # the OTLP receiver the app is sending traces to
        protocols:
          grpc:
          http:

    processors:
      batch:

    exporters:
      otlp/jaeger: # Jaeger supports OTLP directly
        endpoint: http://jaeger:4317
        tls:
          insecure: true

    service:
      pipelines:
        traces/dev:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [otlp/jaeger]
    ~~~

  To use this configuration, unset Jaeger via `SET CLUSTER SETTING trace.jaeger.agent=''`, and then set the OTLP collector using `SET CLUSTER SETTING trace.opentelemetry.collector='localhost:4317'`.

<h4 id="v23-2-0-cluster-settings">Key Cluster Setting Changes</h4>

The following changes should be reviewed prior to upgrading. Default cluster settings will be used unless you have manually set a value for a setting. This can be confirmed by checking the `system.settings` table (`select * from system.settings`) to view the non-default settings.
